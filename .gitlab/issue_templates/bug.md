## How to reproduce
<!--
The steps for reproducing the issue, a description of the data this issue occured on

Note: If the bug occures in the frontend try to reproduce it in an incognito window or delete the browsers cache.

Some remarks on reporting bugs to help the Kaapana team support you efficiently:
1. Please provide logs and terminal sessions as text rather than screenshots. Screenshots are often truncated, hide important context, and make it impossible to copy and paste error messages or codes.
2. Always include the full context. For example, if the output of a command is relevant, the command itself is also necessary to understand the situation.
3. For issues in external components (such as Airflow, Squid Proxy, or MinIO), consider running your logs through an LLM. This can help pinpoint the issue and may also generate useful clues for identifying potential solutions.
4. When reporting problems with a subsystem, it is often straightforward to collect all relevant information (e.g. logs, pod specifications, configurations). Please gather these materials to provide a complete picture.
