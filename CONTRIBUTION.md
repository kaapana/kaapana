## 🌿 Branching Strategy

Kaapana follows the [GitFlow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow) branching model:

- **`develop`** – The main development branch where active work happens.
- **`master`** – The stable branch, updated with each new release.

Please ensure you base your work on the correct branch before submitting merge requests.
