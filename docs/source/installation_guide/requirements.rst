.. hint::
   **Traffic Scope:**

   - **Local:** Traffic confined within your internal network.
   - **External:** Traffic that traverses the internet.

.. attention::
   The ingress/egress rules listed above represent the minimum required for operating the platform.
   During installation, additional ingress may occur when accessing the configured Ubuntu APT mirror or the Snap Store.

.. hint::
    | The platform is based on microk8s which opens certain ports for multi-node setups as listed in `their documentation <https://microk8s.io/docs/services-and-ports>`_. Since the platform is single-node these ports can be blocked for external traffic by the systems firewall if needed.
