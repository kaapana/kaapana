Server Installation
*******************

#. **Host system**

   | You will need some kind of :term:`server` to run the platform on.
   | Minimum specs:

   - OS: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, Ubuntu Server 20.04/22.04 or AlmaLinux 9.3
   - CPU: 8 cores (recommended 16+)
   - RAM: 64GB+ (recommended 128GB+) 
   - Storage for application-data (fast-dir): 100GB (recommended >200GB) 
   - Storage for imaging-data (slow-dir): depends on your needs 



#. **Access to a container registry (online) or a prebuild installer and tarball (offline)**

   Before proceeding with further installation steps, make sure you have access either to container registry or image tarball and microk8s installer installer visit :ref:`build`.

   .. hint::

      | **Accessing container Registry or Tarball with Pre-built Containers**
      | If you are interested in exploring our platform, we encourage you to get in touch with us (:ref:`contact`). Should you choose to do so, we will gladly offer you two options for accessing it. You can either receive credentials for our container registry or receive a tarball that includes the necessary  containers. With these options, you can directly deploy the platform without the need to go through the building process.

   To provide the services in Kaapana, the corresponding containers are needed.
   These can be looked at as normal binaries of Kaapana and therefore only need to be built if you do not have access to already built containers via a container registry or a tarball.



Server Config
=============

Port Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In the default configuration the following ports are opened for incoming traffic on the system

======= ========== =================================================================
 Port    Protocol   Description
======= ========== =================================================================
    80   HTTP       Redirect to HTTPS port 443
   443   HTTPS      Web Interface of the Platform (Interaction, File Upload, APIs)
 11112   DIMSE      DICOM C-STORE SCP to send images to the platform
======= ========== =================================================================

.. attention::
    | Kaapana uses MicroK8s as Kubernetes distribution which also opens ports on the machine it runs on. For an up to date list visit `the corresponding microk8s documentation <https://microk8s.io/docs/services-and-ports>`_.


Proxy
^^^^^

If you need to configure a proxy in your institution to access the internet, you can do this as follows:

#. Open **/etc/environment** on your deployment server:

    :code:`nano /etc/environment`

#. Insert the proxy variables for the proxy in your institution

    :: 

        http_proxy="your.proxy.url:port"
        https_proxy="your.proxy.url:port"
        HTTP_PROXY="your.proxy.url:port"
        HTTPS_PROXY="your.proxy.url:port"


#. Logout :code:`logout` and login again


#. Your network connection is working if you can reach the dkfz website or any other website:

    :code:`curl www.dkfz-heidelberg.de`


.. SSL/TLS Certificates
.. --------------------

Custom DNS Server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    You can configure a custom DNS :code:`my.custom.dns` by executing:

    :code:`sed -i 's/DNS=""/DNS="my.custom.dns"/' ./kaapana/server-installation/server_installation.sh`
    
    If not set manually, the DNS will be configured according to system information.



Installation of Server Dependencies 
===================================

This part describes the preparation of the host system for Kaapana.
Besides a few required software packages, mainly Microk8s is installed, to setup Kubernetes. 

.. hint::

  | **GPU support (Nvidia GPUs)**
  | GPU support requires the installation of Nvidia drivers.
  | Please make sure the :code:`nvidia-smi` command is working as expected!

Before the example platform "Kaapana-platform" can be deployed, all dependencies must be installed on the server.
To do this, you can use the :term:`server-installation-script`. 

.. hint::
   | If you don't want to clone the Kaapana repository, you can copy the :code:`server_installation.sh` script from `Github <https://github.com/kaapana/kaapana/blob/master/server-installation/server_installation.sh>`_.

1. Copy the script to your target-system (server)

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Online

         Script location\: ``kaapana/server-installation/``

      .. tab:: Tarball

         | Script location\: ``kaapana/build/microk8s-offline-installer/``
         | The directory is created in :ref:`build`.
         | Copy the whole directory, as it contains installers for microk8s and helm.

2. Make it executable:

   | :code:`chmod +x server_installation.sh`

3. Execute the server installation script:
   
   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: Online
         | :code:`sudo ./server_installation.sh`
   
      .. tab:: Tarball
         | Use ``--offline`` flag.
         | :code:`sudo ./server_installation.sh --offline`

   .. note::

      | On Almalinux it is recommended to set `-E` flag to preserve user's environmental variables.
      | :code:`sudo -E ./server_installation.sh`

4. Reboot the system 

   | :code:`sudo reboot`

5. (optional) Enable GPU support for Microk8s 

   | :code:`sudo ./server_installation.sh -gpu`

.. hint::

  | **Server Dependency Uninstallation**
  | To uninstall the server-packages, you can use :code:`sudo ./server_installation.sh --uninstall`
