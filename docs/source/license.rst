Considerations on our license choice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use Kaapana to build any product you like, including commercial closed source ones since it is a highly modular system. 
Kaapana is licensed under the `GNU Affero General Public License <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html>`_ 
for now since we want to ensure that we can integrate all developments and contributions to its core system for maximum benefit to the community and give everything back.
We consider switching to a more liberal license in the future.
This decision will depend on how our project develops and what the feedback from the community is regarding the license. 

Kaapana is built upon the great work of many other open source projects, see the documentation for details. For now we only release source code we created ourselves,
since providing pre-built docker containers and licensing for highly modular container based systems is 
`a complex task <https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/2020/04/docker-containers-what-are-the-open-source-licensing-considerations/>`_. 
We have done our very best to fulfil all requirements, and the choice of AGPL was motivated mainly to make sure we can improve and advance Kaapana in the best way for the whole community. If you have thoughts about this or if you disagree with our way using a particular third-party toolkit or miss something please let us know and get in touch. We are open for any feedback and advice on this challenging topic.
