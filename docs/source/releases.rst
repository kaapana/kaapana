Release Notes v0.4.0
********************

December 20, 2024

-------------------------

Data Separation
---------------
* Opensearch authentication with OIDC 
* Metadata exists in project context, i.e., project indices
* Minio authentication with OIDC
* Minio project bucket

Multiinstallable Applications in Project Context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Multiinstallable applications like MITK Workbench, JupyterLab, 3D Slicer, and Tensorboard are adapted to the project context. Only users who are part of a project have access to applications that run in the corresponding project context. These applications receive their data from the dedicated project bucket in Minio.

When an admin launches an instance of a multiinstallable application from the Extensions view, the admin must select the correct project in the header of the website.

DicomWebFilter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The DicomWebFilter enables series-level access control to DICOM data via a DicomWeb API. For example, two users can access the same DICOM study but only specific series within it. This is required in scenarios where a user generates segmentations for certain series of a study and does not want to share these segmentations.

The DicomWebFilter operates as a database storing access information and a REST API supporting the DicomWeb standard. Acting as an intermediary layer, it filters data received from a PACS based on the client’s access token and stored access rules.

A management API is also provided for updating access information.

Keycloak
^^^^^^^^

New Realm Roles and Groups
""""""""""""""""""""""""""
By default, the Kaapana realm in Keycloak includes three roles: :code:`admin`, :code:`project-manager`, and :code:`user`. Policies defining these permissions are managed via ConfigMaps in the auth-backend chart:

- :code:`admin`: Unlimited access to all APIs, routes, and objects.
- :code:`project-manager`: Full access to the project management API.
- :code:`user`: General access to Kaapana's non-system components and project-specific data based on roles.

Keycloak also includes the following groups, each inheriting specific roles:

- :code:`kaapana_admin`: Includes roles :code:`admin`, :code:`project-manager`, :code:`user`.
- :code:`kaapana_project_manager`: Includes roles :code:`project-manager`, `user`.
- :code:`kaapana_user`: Includes role :code:`user`.

Custom Token Mapper
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Custom token mappers populate the client access token with project-specific claims, derived from the access information interface.

Access Information Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This interface includes:

* **Database**: Stores user, project, and permission data.
* **REST API**: Enables Keycloak token mappers to fetch permissions and manage stored information.

Main database objects:

- **Rights**: Key-value claims for access tokens.
- **Projects**: Projects bundle the information.
- **Roles**: Collections of rights mapped to users and projects.
- **UsersProjectsRoles**: Links users, roles, and projects. A user can only have a single UsersProjectsRoles mapping per project. But a user can be mapped to the same role for multiple projects.

Example: If a role that contains the right {"claim_key": "opensearch", "claim_value": "admin_project"} is mapped to user A in Project foo, the access token of user A will contain the claim :code:`"opensearch": ["admin_project_foo"]`. Opensearch is configured accordingly to look for backend-roles in the opensearch claim of the access token and to know which permissions to grant users with the respective roles.

Initial rights, roles, projects and respective mappings can be configured in the `access-information-interface-config <https://codebase.helmholtz.cloud/kaapana/kaapana/-/blob/release/0.4.0/services/data-separation/access-information-interface/access-information-interface-chart/templates/configmap.yaml>`_ . Per default version 0.4.0 comes with only one project role, i.e. :code:`admin`. This role grants access to the project bucket in Minio and the project index in opensearch.

Workflow Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Requests to the Kaapana backend must include a Project-Name cookie or project header.
* Processing containers run in dedicated Kubernetes project namespaces.
* Introduced :code:`kaapanapy` package in base-python-cpu image.
* Operators use project-system-user credentials for authentication to to DicomWebFilter, MinIO and Opensearch.

Project-Based UI
----------------
* Workflow menu requires a selected project.
* Selected project is stored in VueStore and browser cookies.
* Gallery View only shows series that are part of the selected project.
* The confiuraton of any job is extended with a :code:`project_form` that has information about the selected project from which the workflow was started.
* "Active Applications" view shows all multiinstallable applications that are started within the selected project context.
* "Workflow Results" view displays data only from the corresponding project bucket.

Project Management UI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A new project management UI is introduced for viewing all available projects for the user. Admin users can create new projects and add/update/delete users to/from projects.

Project-Based Data Ingestion
----------------------------
Incoming data assignments depend on calling and called AE title conventions (:code:`kp-<project-name>` and :code:`kp-<dataset-name>`). Both arguments have a size limit of 16 chars.

Extension Development Kit (EDK)
-------------------------------
* New application for developing and deploying extensions within Kaapana.
* Includes VSCode-based development environment and local registry.
* Build container images and Helm charts inside the environment and deploy them directly to the platform.

Deploy Script
-------------
* Configurable memory resources for PACS, OpenSearch, and Airflow.
* Ensures stuck Helm charts are deleted during undeployment.

Workflow List
-------------
* Introduced pagination.

DICOM Validation
----------------

* Supports :code:`dciodvfy` and :code:`dicom-validator`.
* Stores validation reports in MinIO with a configurable whitelist for excluded tags.

DAGs
----
* nnUNet workflows updated to v2.
* Added service DAG for workflow result notifications.
* DICOM validation DAGs support manual revalidation.

* Allows adding secrets of new registries to Kubernetes

Operators
---------
* Containerized local operators (e.g., :code:`GetInputOperator`, :code:`MinioOperator`).
* Refactored helper modules in :code:`kaapanapy.helper`.
* Added CI/CD tests for operators.

Bug Fixes
---------
* Fixed :code:`patient_age` inconsistencies in :code:`LocalDcm2JsonOperator`.
* :code:`dicom-init` now waits until opensearch is ready
