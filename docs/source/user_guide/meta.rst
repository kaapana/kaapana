Meta-Dashboard
""""""""""""""

When the focus is more on metadata than visually inspecting the image data directly the *Meta-Dashboard* might be useful. It provides aggregated visualizations for the metadata of the images in the platform and can be used to define datasets based on metadata queries. The Dashboard can be found as *Meta-Dashboard* under the *Meta* menu.
