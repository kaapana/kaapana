Meta-Dashboard
""""""""""""""

The Meta-Dashboard used to be the default way to visualize the metadata of the images on the platform.
While it still can be used for that, for most use-cases it probably makes more sense to use the more powerful :ref:`datasets` component instead.
However, it has the very convenient possiblity to create dashboards which allow to not only visualize column charts but also line graphs or pie charts.
It is based on OpenSearch, therefore for creating customized dashboards, have a look at the `OpenSearch documentation <https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/>`_.
