Projects
^^^^^^^^^^

The Projects page shows a list of all projects a user with the keycloak role *user* has access to.

Users with the keycloak role *project-manager* or *admin* see all existing projects.
They can add and delete projects, add users to existing projects or change the project role of a user.
