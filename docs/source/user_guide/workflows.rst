Workflows
#####################################

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. TODO: WMS should rather be the whole Workflows tab with all its components (?)
.. Adjust the introduction

Starting from Kaapana version 0.2.0, the Kaapana platform is equipped with a 
Workflow Management System (*WMS*) including a handy Data Upload tool :ref:`data_upload` 
and a powerful data inspection tool, Datasets :ref:`datasets`.
The WMS allows the user to interact with the also newly introduced Kaapana object *workflow*. 
The workflow object semantically binds together multiple jobs, their processing data, 
and the orchestrating- and runner-instances of those jobs. 
In order to manage these workflows, the WMS comes with three components:
:ref:`workflow_execution`, :ref:`workflow_list` and :ref:`instance_overview`.


.. TODO: use sth of that? 

.. Data uploaded to the platform is processed within *Workflows*. The execution of this workflows is managed by a workflow management system which in Kaapana is Airflow. In Airflow a workflow is called a DAG (directed acyclic graph) and it consists of operators which perform the actual work. Airflow takes care that the operators of a workflow are executed in the correct order and allows scheduling and error handling necessary to process images at scale. Operators can also be shared between workflows and therefore provide building-blocks for reoccurring tasks in workflows (the :ref:`operators` provides an overview of the available operators).

.. .. hint::
..   Airflow operators are in general implement as containers which are executed in the underlying Kubernetes cluster. When Airflow executes an operator within Kaapana it creates a Kubernetes Job object which then executes the actual container. The Job objects performing the actual processing on the Kubernetes cluster are grouped within the ``jobs`` namespace.

.. A detailed overview of the concepts of Airflow can be found `in their documentation <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/concepts.html>`_.

.. If you are more interested in the technologies, you can get started here:

.. * `Airflow <https://airflow.apache.org/docs/stable/tutorial.html>`_
.. * `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/>`_


.. Execute workflows
.. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Workflows are executed on dataset which contain the data the workflow should process.
.. Datasets can be created using the *Datasets View* or the Meta-Dashboard (see :ref:`creating-datasets`).
.. A workflow can then be executed either directly via the *Dataset View* or via the *Workflow Execution* dialog in the *Workflows* menu.
.. After a workflow is selected in the *Workflow Execution* dialog the user the dialog automatically extends and asks all the parameters necessary to run the workflow including the dataset.
.. After clicking the *Start Workflow* button on the end the workflow is triggered within Airflow and it appears in the *Workflow List* within the *Workflows* menu.
.. Here the execution of the workflow can be monitored. If things are not working as expected the *Workflow List* provides links to jump directly into the Airflow Web Interface where the issue can be investigated in more detail.

.. _data_upload:

Data Upload
^^^^^^^^^^^

There are two ways of getting images into the platform either sending them directly via DICOM (which is the preferred way) or uploading them via the web browser (currently an experimental feature).

.. note::
  When DICOM data is sent to the DICOM receiver of the platform two things happen:

  #. The incoming data is **saved to the local PACS**
  #. **Metadata** of the incoming data is extracted and indexed to allow fast filtering and querying via :ref:`datasets`.

Option 1: Sending images via DICOM DIMSE (preferred)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Images can directly be send via DICOM DIMSE to the DICOM receiver port ``11112`` of the platform.
If you have images locally you can use e.g. `DCMTK <https://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en>`_.
However, any tool that sends images to a DICOM receiver can be used. 

Here is an example of sending images with DCMTK:

::
  
  dcmsend -v <ip-address-of-server> 11112 (default) --scan-directories --call <dataset-name> --scan-pattern '*.dcm' --recurse <data-dir-of-DICOM-images>

.. hint::
    | The called AE title is used to specify the dataset. If the dataset already exist on the platform the new images will be appended.


Option 2: Uploading images via the Web Interface (experimental)
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To upload images via the webfrontend, visit the :Code:`Data Upload` wizard page within the :code:`Workflows` menu of the Web interface. You can upload 
arbitrary data here and access and manage it via minio. Additionally you can import uploaded DICOM or NIfTI data into the internal *PACS*.

Dicom Data
''''''''''

DICOM data should be uploaded in a single compressed zip-file containing folder(s) with DICOM files. The default expected file-extension for DICOMs is 
:code:`.dcm`, but can be configured when triggering the :code:`import-dicoms-in-zip-to-internal-pacs` workflow.

.. _import-uploaded-nifti-files:

NIfTI data
''''''''''



NIfTI data will be converted to DICOM data before being imported into the internal PACS. The workflow for converting NIfTI data to DICOM and uploading it to PACS expects the NIfTI data to be structured in one of the following formats. 
The first format is referred to as the "basic format," while the second format is the " `nnUnetv2 <https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet>`_ data format."

In the basic format, it is assumed that you will place all your images with a unique identifier into a folder, along with the :code:`meta_data.json` file and, if necessary, the :code:`seg_info.json` file.

The basic format allows you to provide metadata for the images and, if applicable, for the segmentations. This additional information is provided within two JSON files:

.. code-block::

    meta-data.json
    seg-info.json




Example: Images without SEG:
////////////////////////////

If your data does not contain segmentations, the directory should be structured as follows:

.. code-block::

    ├───OnlyMRs
    │       Case00.nii.gz
    │       Case02.nii.gz
    │       Case03.nii.gz
    │       meta_data.json

An exemplary :code:`meta_data.json` could  look like this:

.. code-block::

    meta_data.json

        {
            "global_tags": {
                "0008|0060": "MR"
            },
            "series_tags": {
                "Case00.nii": {
                    "0008|103e": "I am unique"
                }
            }
        }

As shown in the example, the :code:`meta_data.json` file allows you to set DICOM tags for the entire dataset using the :code:`"global_tags"` field, and for each series using the :code:`"series_tags"`. The respective file path serves as the identifier.            

Images with SEGs:
/////////////////

If your data also contains segmentations, the import pipeline will convert them and associate them with their respective volumes. Metadata specific to the segmentations is provided by the :code:`seg_info.json` file. Here is a minimal example:

.. code-block::

    seg_info.json

        {
            "algorithm": "Ground truth",
            "seg_info": [
                {
                    "label_name": "prostate",
                    "label_int": "1"
                }
            ]   
        }

The :code:`"algorithm"` field specifies the algorithm or model used to create the segmentation. If the segmentation is provided by a clinician, use :code:`"Ground truth"` as the value. 
The :code:`"seg_info"` field is a list that contains segmentation information for each segmented region or organ. Each block in the :code:`"seg_info"` list includes the :code:`"label_name"` field, which specifies the name of the region or organ, 
and the :code:`"label_int"` field, which represents the respective integer in the segmentation file. If the segmentation includes multiple regions, you need to add a block to the :code:`"seg_info"` list for each region. You can use the following template as a basis:


.. code-block::

    seg_info_template.json (Todo check in code if this is all correct)

        {
            "task_body_part": "<optional - body part>",
            "algorithm": "<optional - algorithm name>",
            "seg_info": [
                {
                    "label_name": "<label 1 name>",
                    "label_int": "<label 1 encoding integer>"
                },
                {
                    "label_name": "<label 2 name>",
                    "label_int": "<label 2 encoding integer>"
                }

            ]
        }

You can use one of the following options to structure your data in a way that allows the parser to associate the cases with their respective segmentations:

.. code-block::

    Option One:

        ├───MRsWithSegmentationsSameFolder
        │       Case11.nii.gz
        │       Case11_segmentation.nii.gz
        │       Case12.nii.gz
        │       Case12_segmentation.nii.gz
        │       seg_info.json

    Option Two:

        ├───MRsWithSegmentationsTwoFolders
        │   │   seg_info.json
        │   │
        │   ├───cases
        │   │       Case03.nii.gz
        │   │       Case04.nii.gz
        │   │
        │   └───segs
        │           Case03.nii.gz
        │           Case04.nii.gz


Images in nnU-Net v2 formatting:
////////////////////////////////

Additonally to the described `basic` format, we also support the `nnU-Net v2` format that was build upon the `medical segmentation decathlon`. This file format combines segmentation meta-data and general meta-data within one file calles :code:`dataset.json`.

.. code-block::

    dataset.json

        {
            "description": "Left and right hippocampus segmentation",
            "file_ending": ".nii.gz",
            "labels": {
                "Anterior": 1,
                "Posterior": 2,
                "background": 0
            },
            "licence": "CC-BY-SA 4.0",
            "channel_names": {
                "0": "MRI"
            },
            "name": "Hippocampus",
            "numTraining": 260,
            "reference": " Vanderbilt University Medical Center",
            "relase": "1.0 04/05/2018"
        }


.. code-block::

.. hint::

    Please note that the :code:`nnU-Net v2` format is particularly suitable for importing data with multiple channels per case. However, it is important to mention that the :code:`basic` parser currently does not support this case.

If you want to import data with multiple channels per case, such as MRI data with FLAIR, T1w, T1gb, and T2w sequences, your data structure will look like this:

.. code-block::

.. _datasets:

Datasets
^^^^^^^^

Datasets is the central component to organize and manage the data on the platform. 

* Intuitive Gallery-style view visualizing thumbnails and (configurable) metadata of DICOM Series
* Multiselect which allows performing actions on multiple series at once including add/removing to/from a dataset, executing workflows on individual series or creating new datasets based on the selection
* Configurable side panel metadata dashboard allowing the exploration of metadata distributions (based on selections)
* Intuitive shortcut based tagging functionality allowing fast and convenient annotation and categorization of the data
* (Full-text) search to filter for items based on metadata
* Open a series in a side panel visualizing the DICOM using (an adjusted) OHIF Viewer-v3 next to all Metadata of the specific series.

In the following chapters, we are going to explore the functionalities.


(Structured) Gallery View
"""""""""""""""""""""""""
Dealing with thousands of DICOMs can be tedious. However, in the recent years, photo gallery apps have established great concepts for those interactions. 
Since DICOMs are not that different from classical images, we got inspired and handel this interaction in similar ways. We call it the Gallery View. 
An item in the Gallery View consists of a thumbnail of the series and its metadata. Everything is completely configurable in :ref:`settings`.
Items are loaded on demand to ensure scalability.

.. image:: https://www.kaapana.ai/kaapana-downloads/kaapana-docs/stable/gif/gallery_view.gif
   :alt: Scrolling through the gallery view



Sometimes it is of interest to structure the data by patient and study. The Structured Gallery View can be enabled in :ref:`settings`.

.. image:: https://www.kaapana.ai/kaapana-downloads/kaapana-docs/stable/gif/structured_gallery_view.gif
   :alt: Scrolling through the structured gallery view

The (Structured) Gallery View enables easy and intuitive interactions with the data on the platform by offering a multi-select functionality. 
Either you select multiple individual series by holding CTRL (CMD on MacOS) and click on the individual series or you make use of the dragging functionality.

Once selected, there are multiple options which are indicated right above the Gallery View. 

* Create a dataset from the selected data. 
* Add selected data to an existing dataset.
* If a dataset is selected (top row), delete the selected items from the currently selected dataset. This only removes the data from the dataset, but does not delete the data from the platform. 
* Execute a workflow with the selected data. Note: While in :ref:`workflow_execution` the dataset is linked to the workflow, triggering a workflow here, will just be a collection of data, i.e. there is no explicit linkage to a dataset.

   :class: half-width-gif

.. note::
  Without an active selection, everything is selected. The 'Items Selected' shows on how many items an action will be performed on.


Dataset management and Workflow Execution
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
The actions to interact with the (Structured) Gallery View are above it. 
The first row is for selecting and managing the datasets. 
Selecting a dataset will instantly update the (Structured) Gallery View.
Next to the selection, there is a button to open the dataset managment dialog which gives an overview of the datasets on the platform but also allows deleting datasets which are not of need anymore.

.. note::
  Deleting a dataset, does *not* delete its containing data form the platform. 

The next row is for filtering and searching. We offer a lucene-based full-text search. 

.. note::
  Some useful commands: 

  * Use `*` for Wildcarding, e.g. `LUNG1-*`. This will show all series where at least on field in the metadata starts with `LUNG1-`.
  * Use `-` for excluding, e.g. `-CHEST`. This will exclude all series where at least on field in the metadata contains `CHEST`.
  * Checkout the `OpenSearch Documentation <https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/query-dsl/full-text/>`__ .

Additional filters can be added which allow for filtering for specific DICOM tags. It comes with a very convenient autocomplete functionality.

.. note:: 
  Individual filters are combined by `AND`, while the different values within a filter are combined by `OR`.

.. image:: https://www.kaapana.ai/kaapana-downloads/kaapana-docs/stable/gif/search.gif
   :alt: Filtering

The next row is responsible for tagging, which is a very convenient way to structure the data. 
Tags are free-text, but the autocomplete functionality allows reusing already existing tags. 
First put all tags of interest and save them. 
To tag a series, first activate the tag(s) by clicking on them, and then clicking on the series will tag it. 
The switch next to the tags definition allows enabling multiple tags at once. 

.. note::
  * Tags can be activated by shortcuts. Pressing `1` (de-)activates the first tag, pressing `2` the second and so on.
  * If a series is already tagged with the current active tag, clicking on the series again, will remove it. This is also the case in multiple tags mode.
  * Another way to remove tags is to click on the `X` next to the tag. (Note: If the tag distribution is visualized in the :ref:`meta_dashboard` on the righthand side, removing a tag this way will not update the dashboard)

   :alt: Tagging items in the gallery view


.. _meta_dashboard:

Metadata Dashboard
""""""""""""""""""
Next to the (Structured) Gallery View is the Metadata Dashboard. It is also configurable in the :ref:`settings`.
It visualizes the Metadata of the currently selected items in the (Structured) Gallery View. 

.. note::
  Clicking on a bar in a bar chart will set the selected value as a filter. Only clicking on search will fire the query.

.. image:: https://www.kaapana.ai/kaapana-downloads/kaapana-docs/stable/gif/dashboard.gif
   :alt: Metadata Dashboard and how to interact with it

Detail View
"""""""""""
Sometimes a thumbnail of a series is not enough. 
Therefore, by double-clicking on a series card or clicking on the eye in the top-right of the thumbnail will open the detail view in the side panel.
The detail view consists of an (adjusted) OHIF-v3 viewer which allows fast and convenient investigation of the whole series. 
Underneath there is the searchable metadata table with all the metadata for the selected series. 

.. image:: https://www.kaapana.ai/kaapana-downloads/kaapana-docs/stable/gif/detail_view.gif
   :alt: Detail view with OHIF viewer and metadata table. 


.. _settings:

Settings
"""""""""
.. todo: should we rename it to UI Configurations? 


.. note::
  It might be confusing that settings is mentioned here, but since the Dataset view is so far the only component which makes use of it, we decided to put it here.

Settings can be found by clicking on the user icon on the top right and on then on Settings. A dialog will open.
As mentioned several times before, the Dataset view is very configurable. 
It is not only possible to choose between the Gallery View and Structured Gallery View but its also possible to decide how many items should be visualized in one row. 

It's also configurable if only the thumbnails or also the metadata of a series should be shown.
Furthermore, for each field in the metadata, there are the following options: 

* Dashboard: Visualize the aggregated metadata the Metadata Dashboard
* Patient View: If the Structured Gallery View is enabled, visualize the values in the patient card
* Study View: If the Structured Gallery View is enabled, visualize the values in the series card
* Series Card: Visualize values in the Series Card
* Truncate: If the values in the Series Card should be truncated to a single line. This allows visually aligning the values to easier compare them across series.

Clicking on save will update the configuration and reload the page. 

.. image:: https://www.kaapana.ai/kaapana-downloads/kaapana-docs/stable/gif/settings.gif
   :alt: Opening the settings window and adjusting the configuration.

.. note::
  For now, the configuration of Settings is only stored in the browsers localstorage. 
  This has the following implications:

  * Deleting the browser cache will restore the default settings
  * Logging in with a different user from the same computer accesses the same settings
  * Logging in with the same user on a different computer will load the default settings






.. _workflow_execution:

Workflow Execution
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Workflow Execution component of the WMS serves to configure and execute workflows on 
the Kaapana platform. This component is the only location on the platform to start 
executable instances which will run as DAG-runs in Kaapana`s workflow engine Airflow. 
The Workflow Execution component can either be directly accessed from Workflows -> Workflow Execution 
or from the Datasets component. 
Workflows are configured in the following way:

* specify runner instance(s), i.e. the instances on which jobs of the configured workflow should be executed. Thereby it is worth mentioning that remote and federated workflow executions are in the new WMS more built-in
* select the Airflow-DAG which should be run and further configured with DAG-specific specification
* select a dataset is selected with the data which should be processed within the workflow

Remote and Federated Workflow Execution
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Workflows can be executed in the following ways:

* Local execution: Workflow is orchestrated by the same instance that serves as runner instance.
* Remote execution: Workflow is orchestrated by another instance that serves as a runner instance.
* Federated execution: The workflows-orchestrating instance coordinates the execution of jobs on both local and remote instances. These jobs then report back data/information to the orchestrating instance. This mode is particularly useful for federated learning scenarios.
  
  - On the orchestrating instance a federated orchestration DAG has to be started which then automatically spawns up runner jobs on the workflow`s runner instances.

Both remote and federated executed workflows are triggered from the Workflow Execution component.
Concerning remote and federated execution of workflows, it is worth mentioning that Kaapana 
provides several security layers in order to avoid adversarial attacks:

* Each Kaapana platform has a username and password-protected login
* The registration of remote instances is handled by the instance name and a random 36-char token
* Each remote/federated communication can be SSL verified if configured
* Each remote/federated communication can be fernet encrypted with a 44-char fernet key if configured
* For each Kaapana platform, the user can configure whether the local instance should check automatically, regularly for updates from connected remote instances or only on demand
* For each Kaapana platform, the user can configure whether the local instance should automatically execute remote/federated workflow jobs which are orchestrated by a connected remote instance
  
  - If automatic execution is not allowed, remote/federated workflows will appear in the Workflow List with a confirmation button

* Remote/federated workflow jobs can always be aborted on the runner instance to give the user of the runner instance full control about her/his instance


.. _workflow_list:

Workflow List
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Workflow List component allows users to visualize all workflows that are currently running 
or have previously run on the platform. The Workflow List comes with the following features:

* comprehensive information regarding the specification of each workflow: workflow name, workflow UUID, dataset, time of workflow creation and time of last workflow update, username, owner instance
* live status updates on the jobs associated with each workflow
* set of workflow actions that users can perform, including the ability to abort, restart, or delete workflows and all their associated jobs

Each row of the Workflow List, which represents one workflow, can be expanded to further 
present all jobs which are associated with the expanded workflow. 
This list of job list comes with the following features:

* comprehensive information regarding the specification of each job: ID of Airflow-DAG, time of job creation and time of last job update, runner instance, owner instance (= owner instance of workflow), configuration object, live updated status of the job
* redirect links to the job's Airflow DAG run to access additional details and insights about the job's execution
* redirect links to the Airflow logs of the job's failed operator for troubleshooting and understanding the cause of the failure
* set of job actions that users can perform, including the ability to abort, restart, or delete jobs

.. image:: https://www.kaapana.ai/kaapana-downloads/kaapana-docs/stable/img/wms_workflow_list.png


Service-workflows
""""""""""""""""""

In addition to regular workflows, the Workflow Management System (WMS) also visualizes background 
services within the platform. These services, such as pipelines triggered whenever a DICOM image 
arrives, are represented as service workflows accompanied by service jobs. 
By incorporating these service workflows into the visualization, users can easily track 
and monitor the execution of these important background processes within the platform.


.. _instance_overview:

Instance Overview
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Instance Overview component mainly serves to manage the local instance and its behaviour 
in a remote/federated workflow execution federation as well as the management of connected 
remote instances.

Local instance
""""""""""""""

* comprehensive information regarding the specification of the local instance: instance name, network including protocol and port, token to establish a secure connection to remote instances, time of instance creation and time of last instance update
* configurations which are used in the remote/federated workflow execution can be defined and modified:
  
  - SSL verification and fernet encryption for remote/federated communication
  - remote/federated syncing and execution privileges
  - permissions for the remote/federated usage of Airflow DAGs and datasets

Since the main aim of the Instance Overview component is the usage of the local Kaapana instance 
in a federation, the presented component also offers the possibility to add remote instances, 
which are described in the following.
When it comes to connecting instance, there are a few important things to take care of:

* instance names have to be unique in a federation of connected instances
* when registering a remote instance you have to specify the remote instance`s name, network, token and fernet key exactly the same as these attributes are set on the remote instance itself

Remote instances
""""""""""""""""

* comprehensive information regarding the specification of the local instance: instance name, network including protocol and port, token to establish a secure connection to remote instances, time of instance creation and time of last instance update, SSL verification, fernet encryption, configurations of the connection remote instance regarding remote/federated syncing and execution privileges and permissions for the remote/federated usage of Airflow DAGs and datasets
* on the local instance, the user can define and modify the following specifications of remote instances: port of the network, token, SSL verification and fernet encryption
