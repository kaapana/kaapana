# Patched Collabora

This is patched version of collabora applying `./001-remove-http-wopisrc.patch` to the codebase and building a patched version of coolwsd binary.

Since the build would slow down the Kaapana build by a strong amount it the Kaapana Image is based on the image `registry.hzdr.de/kaapana/public/collabora-code-patched` which can be generated by `make build` and deployed to the registry by `make deploy`.
