# Additional Unit tests

These tests are additional local tests.
There is also a CI/CD pipeline that tests building, deploying, running dags, etc. that is not included here.

## Pytest

Install requirements and run pytest in the root of the project directory.
Pytest automatically finds all the files in test_*.py pattern.

- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `pytest`
